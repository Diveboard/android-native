   Prerequisites
===================
You must ensure that the following packages are installed:
    - Ant
    - Android SDK

They must be set inside the environment PATH variable in order to be used by
the script.

   Usage
===========
Two scripts are available at the root directory:
    - build_debug: for building the debug APK version.
    - build_release: for building an unsigned release APK version.

Execute the corresponding script, the APK will be then generated
at the root directory.
